Surplus Food Distribution Simulation Data and Code - 2021

This is the code pieces used in the Surplus Food Distribution Simulation.

The parameters used for the data generation program are:

We generate random, logically coherent data for 5000 agent requests and choose our operational city to be 50 × 50 kilometers across, our working hours to be from 06:00 hours to 23:59 hours, any volunteer’s maximum payload capacity to be 100 kilograms. We have taken our threshold values as: T o = 0.25 hour, T d = 2 hours, T r = 3 hours, T w = 0.25 hour, T l = 5%, T a = 20%, T m = 1 kilogram, T P m = 20 kilometers, T P nm = 5 kilometers, and T NP = 100 kilometers.

There is a second piece of code for the graph generation.

The datasets used for graph generation have been provided in the Statistics folder.
