Surplus Food Distribution Simulation Data and Code - 2021 May

These are the Python3 code pieces used in the Surplus Food Distribution Simulation.

The parameters used for the data generation program are:

We generate random, logically coherent data for 5000 agent requests and choose our operational city to be 50 × 50 kilometers across, our working hours to be from 06:00 hours to 23:59 hours, any volunteer’s maximum payload capacity to be 100 kilograms, and, for simplicity, volunteer routes to be straight lines. We have taken our threshold values as: T_o=15 minutes, T_d=120 minutes, T_r=180 minutes, T_w=10 minutes, T_l=5%, T_a=20%, T_m=1000 grams, T_P^m=20 kilometers, T_P^nm=5 kilometers, and T_NP=100 kilometers.

There is a second piece of code for the graph generation.

The datasets used for graph generation have been provided in the Statistics folder.
